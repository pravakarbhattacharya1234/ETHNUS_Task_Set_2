# ETHNUS_Task_Set_2

This code creates a simple web page with a textarea where you can enter your paragraph. As you type or modify the text, the word count will update dynamically below the textarea.
The JavaScript code listens for the 'input' event on the textarea and triggers a word count update. The countWords function splits the input text into words and returns the count. The updated word count is then displayed in the <span> element with the id "count".
Feel free to save the HTML code to an HTML file, the JavaScript code to a separate "script.js" file, and open the HTML file in a web browser to see the responsive paragraph word counter in action.
